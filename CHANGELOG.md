- Fixed encoding/decoding of empty JSON values #1103, #1090 (Simon Jaillet) 
- The offset parameter in the cache memory adapter wasn't used. 1daa738 (David Persson)
- Compatiblity with latest MongoDB driver #1093, #1079, #698 (Simon Jaillet)
- Fixed tests to correctly run and pass on Windows #1073, #1039 (Tsoulloftas Christodoulos, Ciaro Vermeire) 
- Fixed case where custom configuration was ignored when using form helper with checkboxes #1061 (Mark Wilde)
- Fixed #888 to make the any option in Validator::check() work correctly. #1051 (David Persson)
- Fixed issue with compiled view templates on Windows. 32b878a (David Persson)
- Dechunking body data is now more safe and unwanted urldecoding of data is prevented. #1020 (Warren Seymour)
- Fixed bug when using LIMIT, ORDER and hasMany relations with PostgreSql. #1145 (Hamid Reza Koushki)
- Matched implementation with documentation of `Request::accepts()`. The method now returns a boolean 
  when type is provided. #1180, #856 (David Persson, David Rogers)
- Fixed bug where route defaults weren't kept when key params were present in route. (David Persson)
- Fixed several bugs in the FormSignature class. #839, #998, #1173 (Hamid Reza Koushki, David Persson, Ciaro Vermeire, cinaeco)
- Fixed undetected buggy behavior in `Database`/`RecordSet` where records could get out of order and **associated has-many** 
  records would be partially missing. The bug occurred when querying for results with a has-many relationship and without ordering 
  by the primary key of the main record. In all queries involving a has-many relationship, it is adviced to first order by the main 
  id as otherwise an exception will be thrown. 
  We've decided against adding in the main id magically, as silently rewriting users' queries is a rabbit hole we dont't want 
  to go down. In general implicit order by the database is not something to rely on, if you want records in a certain order, always 
  explictly specify it. 
  Fixes #1162 and #1182 (Hamid Reza Koushki, Nate Abele, David Persson)

  ```php
  Posts::find('all', array( // wrong :(
	'order' => 'Comments.created',
	'with' => 'Comments'
  ));

  Posts::find('all', array( // correct :)
	'order' => array('id', 'Comments.created'),
	'with' => 'Comments'
  ));

  Posts::find('all', array( // correct :)
	'order' => array('title', 'id', 'Comments.created'),
	'with' => 'Comments'
  ));
  ```

### Added

- Add support for PATCH HTTP method. (Gavin Davies)
- Allow prefixed names for auth check (i.e. `user.name`) (Alex Soban)
- Allow continued manipulation in dispatcher rules. #1158, #1159 (David Persson, Hamid Reza Koushki)
- Added change log file. You're reading it :) (David Persson)
- Added whitelist support to `Model::validates()` #1143 (Ali Farhadi)
- Added support for atomic increment/decrement in relational databases #1122 (Ali Farhadi)
- Added three-way `'required'` switch option for controlling when to run validation rules against 
  (non-existent) fields. Now by default all fields that are required on *create* keep being required (unchanged),
  however when *updating* validation rules for fields that are not present are skipped. #1118 (Hamid Reza Koushki)
- Added support for REGEXP and SOUNDS LIKE operators for MySQL #1116 (David Persson)
- Coverage summary statistics are now shown when using the test command #1107 (Gavin Davies)
- Added support for using sockets in redis cache adapter. #1076 (Soban Vuex)
- Implemented cache scoping. #1067 (David Persson)
- Added cache adapter base class. (David Persson)
- Implemented cache item persistence through `Cache::PERSIST`. 8a0b24a (David Persson)
- The g11n infrastructure now supports gettext-like contexts. #999 (Jasper Tey) 

### Changed

- The shorthand `Download` header has been deprecated because of its overhead and magicness. #1134 (David Persson)
- When updating an *existing* entity, validation rules for fields that are not present on the to-be-saved entity are
  skipped. The old behavior of requiring on *create and update* can be brought back by using the `'required'` option
  set to `true` with `Model::save()` or `Model::validates()`. #1118  (Hamid Reza Koushki)
- Strategy support for Cache::delete() has been removed as it made no sense. d15f3e7 (David Persson)
- The APC cache adapter now extends the base cache adapter class. Thus the base class must be loaded
  before the APC adapter. Normally this should happen automatically and no updates are needed. However
  if you use an old bootstrap file, the base adapter may not been loaded before the apc one.
  A deprecation notice will then be triggered. (David Persson)

### Backwards Incompatible Changes

- Removed the automatic `__init()` for static classes. fa4ef11 (jails)
- `String::compare()` is now stricter and errors out when one of the provided params is not a string. 7822a2b (David Persson)
- Encoding/decoding of JSON using empty values has been improved. When encoding `null` into JSON
  an empty string instead of an empty array is returned. `{}` is now correctly decoded into an
  empty array. #1103, #1090 (Simon Jaillet)
- When setting Request/Response headers, the new headers are not returned directly. Instead
  one must now first set, then get. #1089 (David Persson)
- Cache adapter instances cannot directly be filtered anymore, instead the `Cache` class' methods may
  be filtered. This clears up some misconceptions and simplifies adapter code. #1068 (David Persson)
- Cache adapters must now extend the new cache adapter base class. (David Persson)
- Cache adapters must now support multi-key reads and writes. (David Persson)
- When used with a parameter `lithium\action\Request::accepts()` now returns a boolean.
  It previously was returning i.e. `'json'` when `application/json` was in accepted content types
  and invoked with `Request::accepts('json')`. This change matches the actual behavior with
  documented (and expected) behavior. (David Persson, David Rogers)
- The `library` command has been extracted into the `li3_lab` plugin. Please install the plugin
  to continue using that command. #1174 (David Persson)
- The `FormSignature` class now uses HMAC with a secret key. This will now require configuring the class
  with an app specific secret key before using it. #1173 (David Persson)
- When installed via composer the default location is now `libraries/lithium`.
- Test `test` command no longer modifies the `error_reporting` setting. Please make sure
  you have set the `error_reporting` to `E_ALL` in your php.ini.
