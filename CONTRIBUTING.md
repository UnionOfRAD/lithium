# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to lithium! This project is built by a thriving community of developers who value cutting-edge technology and concise, maintainable code. If you've found a bug, or have an idea for a feature, we encourage your participation in making lithium better.

**Security vulnerabilities** are an especially sensitive class of bug and should be confidentially reported directly to security@--.me WEBSITE HOST--. Please do not disclose any details publicly. Also see the [full explanation](http://li3.me/development#security).

Here's what you need to stick to in order to have the best chance of getting your code pushed to the core:
* **Conceptual integrity**: code should conform to the goals of the framework
* **Maintainability**: code should pass existing [tests](http://li3.me/docs/specs/accepted/LSR-2-testing.md), have adequate test coverage and should conform to our [coding standards](http://li3.me/docs/specs/accepted/LSR-0-coding.md)
* **Comprehensibility**: code should be concise and expressive, and should be accompanied by new [documentation](http://li3.me/docs/specs/accepted/LSR-1-documenting.md) as appropriate, or updates to existing docs
* **Integration**: finally, pull requests should be submitted against the [`dev`](https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/lithium/tree/dev) branch for integration testing

As always, all contributions are important, and we're very grateful for the help of all those who have gotten us this far. If you're interested in helping out, but feel you could use a little coaching, be sure to drop by `#li3-core` and introduce yourself -- we'd love to help you get started.
