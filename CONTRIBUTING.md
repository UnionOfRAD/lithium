# Contributing guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lithium! This project is built by a thriving community of developers who value cutting-edge technology and concise, maintainable code. If you've found a bug, or have an idea for a feature, we encourage your participation in making Lithium better.

Here's what you need to stick to in order to have the best chance of getting your code pushed to the core:

 * **Integration**: all pull requests should be submitted against the [`dev`](https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/lithium/tree/dev) branch for integration testing
 * **Branching**: create a short and meaningful branch name that starts with either `bug/` or `feature/`. A good example would be `feature/newMediaEncode` or `bug/modelFindFix`
 * **Conceptual integrity**: code should conform to the goals of the framework
 * **Maintainability**: code should pass existing [tests](https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/lithium/wiki/Spec%3A-Testing), have adequate test coverage and should conform to our [coding standards](https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/lithium/wiki/Spec%3A-Coding)
 * **Comprehensibility**: code should be concise and expressive, and should be accompanied by new [documentation](https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/lithium/wiki/Spec%3A-Documenting) as appropriate, or updates to existing docs

As always, all contributions are important, and we're very grateful for the help of all those who have gotten us this far. If you're interested in helping out, but feel you could use a little coaching, be sure to drop by #li3-core and introduce yourself -- we'd love to help you get started.
